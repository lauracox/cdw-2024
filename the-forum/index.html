          <h2>An event for designers.</h2>
          <div class="text">
            <p>The Forum is a day-long conference featuring national and international design leaders, examining a cross section of design practices. We’ll discuss everything from motion graphics to editorial design.</p>
            <p>The conference’s special format allows for in-depth conversation and audience interaction. Themed talks followed by small, intimate panels give everyone the chance to dig into each topic.</p>

              <h3>What can you expect?</h3>
              <p>Over the day, we’ll dive into four design topics, with talks and panels that balance personality and rigor. You’ll hear from industry leaders, award-winning designers, and the best in the business. You’ll have the option to ask questions, grab a coffee together, and make lasting connections.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>What makes The Forum special?</h3>
              <p>While most design conferences touch lightly on a myriad topics, The Forum presents four, each with two perspectives and a panel. It’s designed to tease out the most applicable insights from each field. Not to mention, while most conferences treat their speakers like rockstars, at The Forum, you’ll get to hang out with them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Why is it so cheap?</h3>
              <p>We prefer the term <em>affordable</em>. The Forum is inexpensive because we’re a non-profit that takes the label seriously. Every single dollar goes to putting on the event. Not to mention, we want attendees to feel like they stole something.</p>

Greg’s fascination with modernism began while studying design at Virginia Commonwealth University. His affinity with the movement continues and motivates his ongoing advanced studies at the Basel School of Design in Switzerland most every summer.
                
              As an art director for postage stamp design since 2012, he has designed more than 100 stamps and with a diverse array of subjects, from Star Wars Droids and Batman to Voices of the Harlem Renaissance and The Transcontinental Railroad. 
                
              His work has been recognized in annual design competitions including Graphis, AIGA, Print, and Communication Arts.

It’s chic, comfortable, right on the Downtown Mall, and thanks to the space’s state-of-the-art 16′ x 9′ LED display, design presentations look absolutely incredible.</p>
